Ireland (/ˈaɪərlənd/ ⓘ YRE-lənd; Irish: Éire [ˈeːɾʲə] ⓘ; Ulster-Scots: 
Airlann [ˈɑːrlən]) is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, in north-western 
Europe. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the
 Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the 
 British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest in the world.[10]

Geopolitically, the island of Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland 
(officially named Ireland), an independent state covering five-sixths of the island, 
and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. As of 2022, the population 
of the entire island is just over 7 million, with 5.1 million living in the Republic of 
Ireland and 1.9 million in Northern Ireland, ranking it the second-most populous island in 
Europe after Great Britain.[11]

The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a 
central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. Its lush vegetation 
is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature.
Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages. Today, woodland makes up 
about 10% of the island, compared with a European average of over 33%,[12] with most of 
it being non-native conifer plantations.[13][14] The Irish climate is influenced by the 
Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate,[15] and winters are milder than expected for such 
a northerly area, although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe. Rainfall 
and cloud cover are abundant.
